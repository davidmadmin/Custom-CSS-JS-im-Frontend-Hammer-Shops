| `fh-product-detail.css` | Detail page purchase panel, variant picker, and availability hint styling. |
| `fh-free-shipping.css` | Progress bar styling for the free-shipping promotion banner. |
| `fh-header-navigation.css` | Desktop and mobile header including navigation drawers, mega menus, and sticky page header frame. |
