# SH JavaScript Modules

Load `sh-core.js` first (it stays as a reserved slot for future shared helpers) and then add the feature bundles you need.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sh-core.js` | Reserved placeholder for shared helpers so the registration order stays stable. |
| `sh-shipping-countdown.js` | Handles the shipping countdown timer logic for SH. |
| `sh-shipping-icons.js` | Swaps the default shipping icons for branded alternatives throughout the storefront. |
| `sh-free-shipping.js` | Drives the SH free-shipping progress bar updates. |
